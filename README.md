# Guessing-Game-Intro-Programming-CA

This program was created as part of the Assessment Project for an Intro to Programming module (Level 8) at the Dublin Business School.

It received a final grade of 100%, earned for demonstrating a high standard of coding practices and adding additional features.

### The project requirements
A C# console application for 2 people to play a number guessing game

The first player enters a secret number from 0-20. The second player then has 3 attempts to guess the number entered by the first player.

A message should be displayed according to if the guess was too high, too low or correct.

### Additional Functionality Added
I designed the program to allow for a high degree of customization of the game itself. Settings menus allow the user to change the maximum for the secret number, change the number of guesses allowed, and the number of players. The number of players can be changed to allow a single player to guess against the computer.
